<h2>How is Neko different from DotNet / JVM ?</h2>

<p>
	DotNet and the Java Virtual Machine are both defined by a <em>bytecode</em> language with a <em>static type system</em> based on <em>classes</em>. As a result, you can easily run languages that have a type system compatible with Java or C# on theses virtual machines. But if you have a dynamicly typed language or no class system, you'll have to trick the virtual machine and find a <em>mapping</em> from your type system to the JVM or DotNet one.

<p>
	Neko is a lot more simple. First it is not a <em>bytecode</em> language but a high-level <em>programming</em> language. You don't have then to write a <em>compiler</em> for it, a simple <em>generator</em> that translate your program into the corresponding Neko program is enough. You still have to find a mapping from your type system to Neko <em>data structures</em> but Neko gives you a dynamicly typed language with no fixed class system. You have then to find a <em>runtime mapping</em> so that your program <em>executes</em> correctly on Neko, and not a <em>type mapping</em> so that your program <em>types</em> correcty like with DotNet / JVM.
