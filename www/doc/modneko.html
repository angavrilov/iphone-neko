<h1>An Introduction to Mod_neko</h1>

<p>
	Mod_neko is an Apache <em>module</em> for Neko. It means it is possible to run Neko programs on the server side in order to serve webpages using Apache. Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to configure and use Mod_neko.
</p>

<h2>Apache configuration</h2>

<p>
	Once Neko is correctly configured, you can edit your Apache configuration <code>httpd.conf</code> in order to add <code>mod_neko</code>. Each statement must be added on a single line at the proper place in the Apache configuration file :
</p>

<ul>
	<li>add <code>LoadModule neko_module (your path to mod_neko.ndll)</code></li>
	<li>add <code>AddModule mod_neko.c</code></li>
	<li>add <code>AddHandler neko-handler .n</code></li>
	<li>add <code>index.n</code> to the list of <code>DirectoryIndex</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
	Now that you're done you can restart Apache to check that Mod_neko is correctly loaded. If you have some problem try to check that Neko is correctly configured.
</p>

<h2>Some tests</h2>

<p>
	Now you can simply edit a Neko file and print some welcome message :
</p>

<pre>
    $print("Hello Mod_neko !");
</pre>

<p>
	Compile this file and place the <code>.n</code> file into your web directory so it can be accessed by Apache. Browse it using your <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">favorite</a> web browser and it should display the message.
</p>

<p>
	Now let's try to print the HTTP parameters that are passed to the script, using the <code>mod_neko</code> API :
</p>

<pre>
    get_params = $loader.loadprim("mod_neko@get_params",0);
    $print("PARAMS = "+get_params());
</pre>

<p>
	Don't forget to compile in order to update the <code>.n</code> file before browsing your script. You can now set HTTP parameters <code>(your url)?p1=v1;p2=v2....</code> and see them displayed on your web page.
</p>

<h2>Script versus Application</h2>

<p>
	Since right now Neko is separated into two different phases : <em>compile</em> and <em>run</em> you cannot directly see the modifications you're making to your script since you need to compile first. This have several advantages :
</p>

<ul>
	<li>it runs faster</li>
	<li>syntax is checked at compile-time, before you browse the page</li>
	<li>you don't need to have <em>sources</em> on the server, only binaries is ok</li>
	<li>you can run your module in <em>application mode</em> (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Right now however everytime a request is made by the browser, Mod_neko is loading the module and executing it. If you have a very big script it might take some time (although it's already faster than other web scripting languages).
</p>

<p>
	The idea of running in <em>Application Mode</em> is to have first an initialization phase for your script that will create objects, load libraries, initialize global datas, and then setup an <em>entry point</em> which will be the function called for every request. Here's a small sample :
</p>

<pre>
    $print("Initializing...");

    // this is the entry point
    entry = function() {
        $print("Main...");
    }

    // setup the entry point
    set_main = $loader.loadprim("mod_neko@cgi_set_main",1);
    set_main(entry);

    // call it the first time as well
    entry();
</pre>

<p>
	Now after compiling if you browse this page it should display <code>Initializing... Main...</code> the first time and then <code>Main...</code> for every refresh. It means that you can initialize a lot of things at loading time and store values into globals that will be persistent between calls.
</p>

<p>
	If you recompile, this will change the timestamp of the <code>.n</code> file so it will reload and initialize it again. That means that you should be able to reload everything you need at loading time.
</p>
