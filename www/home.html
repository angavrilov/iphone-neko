<h1>The Neko Programming Language</h1>

<p>
	Neko is an <em>intermediate</em> programming language. It has been designed to provide a common runtime for several different languages. Learning and using Neko is very easy, but you're not supposed to directly program in Neko. Instead, you can write a <em>generator</em> from your preferred language to Neko and then use the Neko runtime to compile, run, and access libraries.
</p>

<p>
	Neko is a good way for <em>language designers</em> to focus on design and reuse a fast and well-designed runtime, as well as existing libraries for accessing filesystem, network, databases, xml...

<h1>The Neko Virtual Machine</h1>

<p>
	Neko has a <i>compiler</i> and a <i>virtual machine</i>. The Virtual Machine is very lightweight and yet well optimized so it is running very quickly. The VM can be easily embeded into any application and your libraries can be accessed using the C <i>foreign function interface</i>.
</p>

<p>
	The <i>compiler</i> converts a source <code>.neko</code> file into a bytecode <code>.n</code> file that can be executed with the Virtual Machine. The compiler is currently a standalone commandline executable, but will soon be available as a Neko Library, so you can use it from any Neko program.

<h1>Mod_neko</h1>

<p>
	Neko comes with several libraries. One of these is <code>mod_neko</code>, which embeds the Neko Virtual Machine into the Apache web server, so you can use Neko to generate webpages. This website is actually generated using Neko.
